'''

1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?

# For me because I forgot something silly it was like an 8. But really probably a 4.


2. What was the hardest part of this lab?

# Oh, it passed. Wow. OK, then the hardest part for me was initially figuring out the correct syntax for the "Choice" part here.
